**Project: Application Rejection Email Classification**

**Overview:**

For this project, I worked on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, titled "Detect Reject Emails," by SethPoly. The dataset consists of emails with the status of either "reject" or "not_reject." The goal was to analyze these emails to detect patterns and characteristics that differentiate rejection emails from non-rejection emails.

**Objective:**

The main objective of this project was to develop a machine-learning model capable of classifying emails as either "reject" or "not_reject." This was done through a series of tasks including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, and model training using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

**Tasks and Methodology:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - Loaded the dataset and performed initial exploration.
   - Cleaned the email text by removing newline characters to prepare the data for analysis.
   - Tokenized the email content into individual words (tokens) for further processing.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   - Added a column to the dataset to calculate the number of tokens in each email.
   - Visualized the average length of emails across the two categories ("reject" and "not_reject") using bar plots to identify any patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering:**

   - Calculated the lexical richness of each email, defined as the ratio of unique tokens to the total number of tokens, and added this as a new feature to the dataset.
   - Analyzed the difference in lexical richness between "reject" and "not_reject" emails to understand vocabulary usage.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Trained a Word2Vec model on the tokenized email content to capture the semantic relationships between words.
   - Used the trained model to identify the top 20 words most similar to the word "developer," providing insights into the context in which this term is used within the dataset.

**Key Findings:**

- **Email Length and Status:**

  - On average, non-rejection emails were found to be longer than rejection emails. This could indicate that non-rejection emails tend to provide more detailed information or have a more complex structure.

- **Lexical Richness:**

  - Both rejection and non-rejection emails had similar levels of lexical richness, suggesting that the variety of vocabulary used is fairly consistent across both types of emails.

- **Word Similarity Analysis:**
  - The Word2Vec model revealed the most semantically similar words to "developer," which could help understand the context in which job-related terms are used in the dataset.

**Tools and Technologies:**

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Gensim (for Word2Vec)
- Scikit-learn

**Conclusion:**

This project provided valuable experience in working with text data and natural language processing techniques. It also highlighted the challenges of classifying unstructured text data and the importance of thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering in developing effective machine learning models.
